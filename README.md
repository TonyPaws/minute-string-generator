# Unique Minute String Generator

This project is a web application that generates a unique, human-readable sentence for every minute of the day. It allows users to either enter a sentence manually or select words from dropdown lists to find the corresponding time.

## Features

- **Unique Sentence Generation**: Generates a unique sentence for each minute of the day using predefined lists of nouns, adverbs, transitive verbs, and adjectives.
- **Time Lookup**: Allows users to enter a sentence and find the corresponding time.
- **Dropdown Selection**: Users can opt to select each word from dropdown lists instead of entering a sentence manually.
- **Current Time Display**: Displays the current time and updates every minute.
- **Responsive Design**: Simple and clean UI that works well on different screen sizes.

## Project Status

**Note:** This application is currently a proof of concept. The mapping function used to generate sentences from timestamps and vice versa may change in future updates. This could affect the reproducibility of results over different versions.
